## Problem:

You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing **a single day** to buy one stock and choosing **a different day** in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**Notice that you can sell first and buy later. Buy before you sell, duh!**

`Example 1:`
`Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
`Output: 5`
`Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.`

`Example 2:`
`Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
`Output: 0`
`Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.`
