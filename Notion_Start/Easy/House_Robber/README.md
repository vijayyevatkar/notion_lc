## Problem:

Consecutive houses cannot be robbed. Optimize the sequence of houses to be robbed for maximum profit.
Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob

`Example 1:`
`Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]`
`Output: 4`
`Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).`
`Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.`

`Example 2:`
`Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]`
`Output: 12`
`Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).`
`Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.`
